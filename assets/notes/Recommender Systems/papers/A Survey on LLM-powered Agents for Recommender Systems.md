# A Survey on LLM-powered Agents for Recommender Systems[^1]

与Towards Agentic Recommender Systems in the Era of Multimodal[^2]内容大致重叠

方法分类

- 面向推荐器的方法

	> Recommender-oriented approaches focus on developing intelligent recommendation equipped with enhanced planning, reasoning, memory, and tool-using capabilities.

- 面向交互的方法

	> Interaction-oriented methods focus on enabling natural language interaction and enhancing recommendation interpretability through conversational engagement.

- 面向模拟的方法

	> Simulation-oriented methods aim to authentically replicate user behaviors and preferences through sophisticated simulation techniques.
