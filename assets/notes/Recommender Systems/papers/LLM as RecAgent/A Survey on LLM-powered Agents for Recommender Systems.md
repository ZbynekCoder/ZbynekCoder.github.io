# A Survey on LLM-powered Agents for Recommender Systems[^1]

方法论分类
- Recommender-oriented: LLMs leverage users’ historical behaviors to generate direct recommendation decisions
- Interaction-oriented: conduct human-like dialogues or explanation while making recommendations
- Simulation-oriented: using agents to simulate user behaviors and item characteristics in RSs
